# Ember-cli-json-schema

https://travis-ci.org/southpolesteve/ember-cli-json-schema.svg?branch=master

WARNING: This is still very much a work in progress. It does not yet fully implement the json-schema spec and is missing many critical features. I am currently working directly against master so expect breaking changes at any moment.
